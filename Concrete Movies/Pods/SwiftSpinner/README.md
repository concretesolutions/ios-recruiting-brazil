SwiftSpinner is an extra beautiful activity indicator with plain and bold style fitting iOS 8 design very well. It uses dynamic blur and translucency to overlay the current screen contents and display an activity indicator with text (or the so called “spinner”).

I developed it for my Swift app called **Doodle Doodle** and wanted to share it with everyone.

This is how the activity looks like (from the demo app):

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the DemoApp directory first. That’ll run the demo program which shows you how the spinner looks like and what it can do.

#### Code samples

The simple code to get `SwiftSpinner` running in your own app.

 * In case you installed SwiftSpinner via CocoaPods you need to import it (add this somewhere at the top of your source code file):

```swift
import SwiftSpinner
```

 * When you want to show an animated activity (eg. rings are randomly rotating around):

```swift
SwiftSpinner.show("Connecting to satellite...")
```

 * If you want to show a static activity indicator (eg. a message with two complete rings around it)

```swift
SwiftSpinner.show("Failed to connect, waiting...", animated: false)
```

 * When you want to hide the activity:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.hide()
```

In case you want to do something after the hiding animation completes you can provide a closure to the `hide()` method:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.hide({
  //do stuff
})
```


That's all. If you want to change the text of the current activity, just call `show(...)` again, this will animate the old text into the new text.

## Beyond the basics

If you are using `SwiftSpinner` to show an alert message you can also easily add a dismiss handler:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.show("Connecting \nto satellite...").addTapHandler({
  SwiftSpinner.hide()
})
```

Or even add a subtitle to let the user know they can tap to do stuff:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.show("Connecting \nto satellite...").addTapHandler({
  SwiftSpinner.hide()
}, subtitle: "Tap to hide while connecting! This will affect only the current operation.")
```

In case you want to adjust the font of the spinner title:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.setTitleFont(UIFont(name: "Futura", size: 22.0))
```

To reset back to the default font:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.setTitleFont(nil)
```

In case you want to change an arbitrary aspect of the text on screen access directly:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.shared.titleLabel
SwiftSpinner.shared.subtitleLabel
```

You can show a spinner only if certain amount of time has passed (e.g. if you are downloading a file - show a message only if the operation takes longer than certain amount of time):

```swift
SwiftSpinner.show(delay: 2.0, title: "It's taking longer than expected")
```

If you call `show(…)` or `hide()` before the `delay` time has passed - this will clear the call to `show(delay: …)`.

You show a message for a certain duration:
```swift
SwiftSpinner.show(duration: 4.0, title: "It's taking longer than expected")
```

Or you can use `SwiftSpinner` as a progress bar by directly setting the current progress like so:

```swift
SwiftSpinner.show(progress: 0.2, title: "Downloading Data...") // 20% trough the process
```

If you want to see the content behind the spinner, set the showBlurBackground to false:
```swift
SwiftSpinner.showBlurBackground = false
```

## Requirements

UIKit must be imported. If you are using SwiftSpinner in an App Extension, you must add `EXTENSION` to your `Other Swift Flags` Build Settings.

## Installation

`SwiftSpinner` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```
pod "SwiftSpinner"
```

In case you don’t want to use CocoaPods - just copy the file **SwiftSpinner/SwiftSpinner.swift** to your Xcode project.
